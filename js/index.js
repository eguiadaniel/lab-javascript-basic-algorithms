- It seems that the navigator has the longest name, it has XX characters. or
- Wow, you both have equally long names, XX characters!.*/

/* Iteration 3: Loops
3.1 Print all the characters of the driver's name, separated by a space and in capitals i.e. "J O H N"

3.2 Print all the characters of the navigator's name, in reverse order. i.e. "nhoJ"

3.3 Depending on the lexicographic order of the strings, print:
- The driver's name goes first.
- Yo, the navigator goes first definitely.
- What?! You both have the same name?

TIP From ZÃ©: 
`A` > `B` -> Goes before on the dictionary
`Hello` localCompare(`Help`)); -> Each word its translated to a number and soma are bigger than others
